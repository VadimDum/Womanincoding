## Background <a name="background"></a>

The analysis which is provided in the notebook was prepared for my wife. In the past several years, she is trying to convince herself to make a big move in her professional life, from finance to programming. Currently, she highly paid finance professional with high income but with no pleasure from the work and extremely standard tasks. What's also important, she is looking for right country for getting professional trainings in programming as well as some experience in living abroad.

I decided to prepare short comparison for women experience in programming by countries to empower her for the next step.

## Data sources <a name="data"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2019 and 2020, as the most recent sources for:

1. In which countries the proportion of professional woman-programmers is highest in 2019 and 2020?
2. What's top average working hours by countries in 2019 and 2020?
3. How many years of it can take to professional level by countries?

The original data sources can be found [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey)

## Files <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  The notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.
